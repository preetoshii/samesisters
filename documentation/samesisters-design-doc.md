# Samesisters Website Design Document

## What is Samesisters?

Samesisters is a custom clothing brand by designer Sachi Raval. She grew up in her mother's boutique, surrounded by fabrics and traditional tailoring practices. The brand focuses on occasion wear with South Asian design influences, creating pieces for both men and women (though the aesthetic leans feminine).

Each piece is made-to-order and customized for the individual customer - not just in size, but in fabric choice, length, details, and modifications. The business model is built around personal relationships: between Sachi and her customers, and between customers and their clothing. This is slow fashion taken to its logical conclusion - every piece is one-of-a-kind, personally sourced, and made specifically for one person.

## Core Concept: Swipe-First Fashion Discovery

A radically minimal, single-interaction website where users discover Samesisters through swiping - building both a personalized collection and a deeper understanding of the brand's philosophy. The interface mirrors Sachi's own curatorial process: just as she carefully selects each fabric and design element, users curate their own experience through deliberate choices, creating a digital reflection of the traditional, thoughtful approach to custom clothing.

**The cards themselves are educational**: Through the act of swiping, users naturally learn what Samesisters offers - but this education happens subtly. Philosophy cards present opinions users can agree or disagree with, yet each opinion sneakily conveys information about how Samesisters works. Filter cards reveal the brand makes for all genders. Fabric cards show the personal sourcing approach. The user thinks they're just expressing preferences, but they're actually learning the entire brand story through those preferences.

## Fabric Philosophy: The Living Inventory

Unlike traditional fashion brands with predictable supply chains, Samesisters operates on a philosophy of discovery. Sachi personally sources each fabric, traveling to textile markets, visiting closing mills, and building relationships with artisan weavers. This means our fabric inventory is alive - constantly changing, never repeated.

**What this means:**
- Every fabric has a story and finite yardage
- What's available today won't be here next month
- Each piece is truly limited edition by nature, not marketing
- Your garment will never be mass-produced

**This isn't a limitation - it's liberation:**
- No more "sold out in your size" disappointments
- No risk of seeing your "unique" piece on someone else
- Real scarcity that creates real value
- A reason to act when something speaks to you

When you see a fabric you love in the customization interface, know that Sachi personally chose it, negotiated for it, and carried it back with intention. This isn't fast fashion with endless restocks - when it's gone, it's truly gone. But something equally beautiful will take its place, continuing the cycle of discovery that makes each Samesisters piece genuinely one-of-a-kind.

## What the Experience Feels Like

You land on a philosophy card - elegant typography over textured fabric: "Fashion should come to me, not the other way around." Below, a subtle instruction: "Swipe right on what speaks to you."

You swipe. 

The second and third cards ask about your style preferences through visual choices - feminine silhouettes, masculine cuts. Full-card visualizations that you swipe right or left on. Your right swipes add corresponding pieces to your upcoming cards. If you swipe left on both, you'll see no clothing - just philosophy, fabrics, and Sachi's story.

The next card might be a philosophy: "A piece feels more valuable when it's made just for me" over a textured background. You pause, then swipe right. It resonates.

A few cards later, you see fabric moving - a video loop of silk catching light, with Sachi's caption: "Found in a 100-year-old shop in Delhi." The fabric seems alive. You swipe right, curious about what could be made from it.

You tap on a piece that catches your eye. The card expands smoothly from its position, filling your screen. Now you can tap through multiple images in the gallery, scroll to see fabric options - each with its own story like "Found in Hyderabad!" You read about who has worn this piece before, why Sachi created it. You simply enter your height and usual size. As you change fabric selections, the price updates with a subtle pop animation showing "Around $XXX" - automatically calculated from the piece's complexity and time to make. At the bottom of the screen, a floating "Text Sachi!" button invites conversation instead of checkout. When done exploring, you tap the X and the card shrinks back to its place in the deck.

At any point, you can tap the Collection tab at the bottom to see your curated selection - a digital scrapbook where all your swiped cards are pinned at slight angles, like a mood board. Philosophy and style cards show what resonates with you, fabric cards show what caught your eye, and piece cards can be tapped to expand again. When done, tap X to return to your scrapbook.

The entire experience feels more like meditation than shopping. Each swipe is deliberate. Each piece earned your attention. By the time you're ready to message Sachi, you don't just know what Samesisters sells - you understand what it stands for, and more importantly, what you stand for. There's no checkout, just the beginning of a conversation.

## Card Types

All cards use full-card visuals - images or videos fill the entire card space with subtle overlays for text or controls as needed. This creates an immersive, visual-first experience across all card types.

### 1. Filter Cards (Dynamic Deck Builders)
Appear first in the deck sequence, before all other cards.

**Gender Expression Cards**:
- "Feminine Silhouettes" - Full-card flowing dress form visualization
- "Masculine Cuts" - Full-card structured jacket form visualization  
- Split-screen or diptych layouts filling entire card
- No binary language, just visual representation
- Swiping right adds corresponding pieces to the deck
- Can swipe right on both, one, or neither
- Pieces aren't pre-loaded - only added after filter selection

### 2. Piece Cards
- Editorial-quality photography fills entire card
- Subtle info overlay: piece name, "Around $XXX" starting price
- **Tags displayed**: "garden party" "when you're feeling creative" "for making an entrance"
- **Tap to expand**: Card grows to fill screen with scrollable content:
  - Image gallery (tap to advance through images)
  - The story behind the piece
  - Tags shown prominently
  - Customization options with live price updates (pop animation on changes)
  - Direct purchase or "Design with Sachi" paths
  - X button to minimize back to deck
- Swipe right adds to "Your Collection"
- Each card maintains its own expanded state

**Educational Purpose of Tags**: These tags subtly teach users what Samesisters creates - pieces for special moments, not everyday basics. Tags blend literal occasions ("garden party"), moods ("when you're feeling bold"), and moments ("for making an entrance"). This creates an emotional connection while communicating the brand's focus on elevated, intentional dressing. Users self-select by swiping right on pieces tagged for feelings and occasions that resonate with them.

### 3. Philosophy Cards
**Opinion statements overlaid on full-card textured fabric backgrounds:**
- "A piece feels more valuable when it's made just for me"
- "The best fabrics can't be found in catalogs"
- "Small imperfections make a garment feel human"
- "Knowing who made my clothes adds soul to them"
- "There's magic in owning something no one else has"
- "A conversation with the maker beats clicking 'buy now'"
- "Fashion should come to me, not the other way around"
- "The story behind a fabric matters as much as how it looks"

Typography centered on textured backgrounds that fill the entire card. Users think they're sharing opinions, but they're learning what makes Samesisters different.

### 4. Sachi Moments
**Video cards with full-card preview and play button overlay:**
- "My inspiration" (15s) - What drives her design philosophy
- "How it started for me" (20s) - Growing up in her mother's boutique
- "How I like to work with clients" (30s) - Her direct, personal approach
- "Every fabric has a story" (15s) - Why she sources personally
- "My journey to America" (25s) - Cultural confusion and finding her way

Video preview fills card with title and duration overlay. Raw, authentic, directly addressing the camera. Tapping play expands the card to full-screen video with audio. X button stops video and returns to default card state.

### 6. Fabric Story Cards
**Full-card looping videos with caption and tag overlays:**
- Video fills entire card showing fabric's drape, texture, and how it catches light
- Sachi's discovery story overlaid: "Found in a 100-year-old shop in Delhi"
- Fabric characteristic tags displayed subtly: "airy" "luminous" "drapes-well"
- Subtle indicator of yards remaining (e.g., "12 yards available")
- Other captions: "The last 10 yards from a closing mill in Ahmedabad", "Haggled for this at 5am in the Jaipur textile market"
- Creates visceral connection to material before seeing pieces
- Tags help customers understand fabric properties beyond visual
- **No expansion state** - swipe only

**Additional State - Within Piece Card Customization**:
- Same fabric cards appear in horizontal scrollable row
- Smaller size but maintains video loop and caption
- Shows remaining yards more prominently
- Tappable to select for the piece
- Selected state shows subtle highlight
- Maintains the personal story even in selection context

### Navigation - Floating Tab Bar

**Persistent navigation element**:
- Positioned near bottom of screen
- Rounded edges, floating design
- Two tabs: "Swipe" (main experience) and "Collection" (your picks)
- Subtle animation when switching
- Always accessible but goes behind expanded cards
- Semi-transparent background with blur effect
- Cards expand over the tab navigation when in detail view

### Detailed View Specifications

#### Card Component Architecture
Each card is a self-contained component with two states: default and expanded. The detail view is not a separate page or modal - it's the card expanding to fill the screen.

**Implementation Structure**:
```javascript
// Base card wrapper handles shared behavior
<Card 
  type="piece" 
  content={pieceData}
  onSwipe={handleSwipe}
  canExpand={true}
/>

// Card component routes to specific renderers
function Card({ type, content, canExpand }) {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);
  
  // Shared swipe/expand logic here
  
  return (
    <AnimatedWrapper>
      {type === 'piece' && <PieceCard {...content} expanded={isExpanded} />}
      {type === 'philosophy' && <PhilosophyCard {...content} />}
      {type === 'style' && <StylePreferenceCard {...content} />}
      {type === 'filter' && <FilterCard {...content} />}
      {type === 'sachi' && <SachiVideoCard {...content} expanded={isExpanded} />}
      {type === 'fabric' && <FabricStoryCard {...content} />}
    </AnimatedWrapper>
  );
}
```

**Shared aspects**: Swipe gesture handling, deck position tracking, animation wrappers
**Distinct aspects**: Content rendering, expansion behavior, interaction patterns

**Expansion Animation**:
- Card grows from its current position to full screen
- Smooth scaling animation maintains visual continuity
- Once expanded, card becomes scrollable
- X button (top-right) minimizes card back to original position
- Deck position is preserved - when minimized, you return to exactly where you were
- Tab navigation is covered by expanded card

#### Piece Card - Expanded State
**Triggered by**: Tapping the card from swipe interface OR collection view

**Behavior**:
- Card expands to full screen with smooth animation
- Content becomes scrollable once expanded
- Price changes trigger subtle "pop" animation to draw attention
- X button returns card to its original context (swipe deck or collection)

**Layout** (scrollable):
```
[X button - top right]
[Hero Image - Current configuration]
[Tap dots/indicators for gallery navigation - centered below image]
[Piece Name]
[Around $XXX - Animates on change]

[Fabric Selection - "Fabrics in our inventory!"]:
- Shows only fabrics compatible with this piece
- Fabric cards in scrollable row
- Each shows fabric video with caption: "Found in Hyderabad!"
- Remaining yards shown (e.g., "8 yards left")
- Selected fabric highlighted
- Price updates to show new approximate total

[Size]:
- Your height: [input field]
- Usual size: [S/M/L/XL]

[The Story - Expandable]:
- Who has worn this
- Inspiration behind it
- Styling suggestions

[Floating CTA - Fixed to bottom]:
"Text Sachi!" - Replaces traditional add to cart
[Tooltip: "Looking for 'add to cart'?" - explains personal approach]
```

**Key Features**:
- Image gallery uses tap navigation (not swipes) to avoid confusion with main card swiping
- Price updates with subtle "pop" animation showing "Around $XXX"
- Visual feedback for each selection
- Availability indicators for fabrics (yards remaining)
- Maintains swipe position when minimized
- Floating "Text Sachi!" CTA fixed to bottom of expanded card
- Tooltip explains why there's no traditional cart

##### Customization Experience

The expanded card includes minimal customization options - just enough to start the conversation with Sachi.

**Fabric Selection Experience**:
- Shows as "Fabrics in our inventory!"
- Displays only fabrics compatible with this specific piece
- Each fabric card maintains its video and caption from main deck
- Shows remaining yardage clearly
- Selected fabric highlights with subtle animation
- Price updates automatically to show approximate total
- If no compatible fabrics available, shows message to contact Sachi

**Sizing Approach - Ultra Simple**:
- Just two fields: Height + usual size (S/M/L/XL)
- No complex measurements needed
- Sachi handles fit details in conversation

**The Messaging CTA**:
Instead of "Add to Cart", a floating button fixed to bottom of screen:
- "Text Sachi!" as primary CTA
- Stays visible while scrolling through options
- Tooltip icon shows "Looking for 'add to cart'?"
- Clicking opens messaging options

When "Text Sachi!" is clicked:
```
How would you like to connect?
○ Text Message (SMS)
○ WhatsApp
○ Instagram DM
```

Selections are formatted into a message and copied to clipboard for easy pasting. User's choices become the starting point for their conversation with Sachi.

**Philosophy**: No cart, no complex order system - just a direct line to Sachi. The website becomes a beautiful portal to a personal relationship, not another impersonal shopping experience.

**The Tooltip - "Looking for 'add to cart'?"**:
*"I believe every piece should come with a conversation. When you know the hands that made your clothes, when you've talked through the details together, the piece becomes more than fashion - it becomes part of your story. Let's chat about what you're envisioning. I'll copy your selections to make messaging easy. The price shown is approximate - we'll confirm everything together. This personal connection is what makes your piece truly yours."*

**Philosophy**: No cart, no complex order system - just a direct line to Sachi. The website becomes a beautiful portal to a personal relationship, not another impersonal shopping experience.

#### Sachi Moment Card - Expanded State
**Triggered by**: Tapping play button on card

**Behavior**:
- Card expands to full screen
- Video preview transitions to playing video with audio
- No additional UI elements - pure video experience
- Tap anywhere or X button pauses video and returns to default state

#### Other Card Types - Expanded States
- **Philosophy Cards**: May not need expanded state
- **Style Cards**: May not need expanded state  
- **Filter Cards**: Already interactive in default state
- **Fabric Story Cards**: Could expand to show larger video loop with more details

#### Collection View - Scrapbook Layout
**Visual Design**:
- All right-swiped cards displayed as if pinned to a bulletin board
- Each card slightly rotated (random subtle angles)
- Maintains card aspect ratios from swipe view
- Mixed card types create visual variety
- Scrollable vertical layout
- Cards cast subtle shadows for depth

**Card Types in Collection**:
- **Piece cards**: Tappable to expand and customize
- **Sachi videos**: Tappable to play full-screen
- **Philosophy cards**: Static, shows your values
- **Fabric cards**: Static, shows what caught your eye
- Filter cards are NOT saved to collection

**Interaction**:
- Only piece cards and Sachi video cards are tappable/expandable
- Tapping expandable cards triggers expansion animation
- Card expands from its position in the collection
- X button returns card to its collection position
- Non-expandable cards create context and personality
- Collection scroll position preserved

#### Customization Within Expanded Card

The expanded card includes all customization options inline - no separate flow needed. This familiar e-commerce pattern reduces friction while maintaining the personal touch.

**Fabric Selection Experience**:
- Shows as "Fabrics in our inventory!"
- Displays actual fabric cards with captions like "Found this in Hyderabad!"
- Each fabric shows remaining quantity
- Selected fabric highlights with subtle animation
- Price updates automatically

**Sizing Approach - "Fit just for you"**:
- Starts simple: Height + usual size (S/M/L/XL)
- "Not sure about sizing?" links to Sachi video fitting
- Video fittings available for those wanting perfect fit
- Small text: "First order includes free adjustments"
- Balances simplicity with customization promise

**The Video Fitting Option**:
- 10-minute call with Sachi
- She guides through basic measurements
- Personal attention as luxury feature
- $25 fee credited to order
- Books directly in interface

**Philosophy**: Keep ordering simple for most, offer personal service for those who want it. The limitation of being small becomes the feature - you get Sachi's attention.

### Mobile vs Desktop Differences

#### Mobile (Primary)
- Swipe gestures for everything
- Full-screen cards
- Floating tab navigation at bottom (hidden when card expanded)
- Expanded cards use full screen with floating "Text Sachi!" CTA
- Minimal customization keeps mobile experience clean

#### Desktop (Adapted)
- Arrow keys for swiping
- Click and drag also works
- Floating tab navigation remains at bottom (hidden when card expanded)
- Piece details in expanded card state
- Same floating "Text Sachi!" CTA approach
- Slightly larger fabric selection carousel

## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Typography**: System fonts or one custom font maximum
- **Color**: Minimal palette, mostly neutrals
- **Motion**: Framer Motion for all animations
- **Photography/Video**: Optimized before upload, no complex CDN
- **Full-card principle**: Every card type uses edge-to-edge visuals

### Interaction Design
- **Primary gesture**: Horizontal swipe (mobile) or arrow keys (desktop)
- **Secondary**: Tap/click to explore
- **No scroll in default view**: Everything is card-based
- **In-card navigation**: Always tap-based (no swipes within cards)
- **Tooltips**: Simple CSS hover states
- **Quick**: Instant response with React's fast rendering

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Data-first approach: JSON schemas define the entire system
- Single Page Application with card-centric architecture
- Cards are self-contained React components with multiple states
- Preload next 3 cards for smooth swiping
- Content stored as static JSON files (pieces.json, fabrics.json, etc.)
- localStorage for user preferences and collection (no cross-device sync for simplicity)
- Framer Motion handles all animations
- Simple gesture detection for swipe vs tap
- Clipboard API for message copying
- Basic app links for opening messaging apps
- Videos stored directly in GitHub repo (optimized before upload)

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-optimized swipe gestures for card navigation
- Tap gestures for all in-card interactions (gallery, buttons, etc.)
- Portrait-first design
- Minimal dependencies = fast load times
- Videos optimized before upload

### Performance
- Vite's fast HMR for development
- Minimal bundle size with few dependencies
- Lazy load videos and images
- Vercel's edge network for fast delivery

## Post-Purchase Experience

### After the Conversation
Once Sachi and the customer agree on the final design through messaging:
- Sachi sends payment link directly in the chat
- Customer receives confirmation via same messaging channel
- Sachi shares progress photos as she makes the piece
- All communication stays in the original conversation thread

### Building Relationships
- Follow-up messages with styling tips
- Photos of the finished piece before shipping
- Check-in after delivery
- All through the same personal channel - no automated emails

## Technical Stack Recommendations

### Core Stack (Minimal & Lean)
- **React** - Component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Type safety to catch errors early (strongly recommended)
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations for card transitions
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting
- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

### Why This Minimal Stack Works
- **No backend needed** - Messaging handles orders
- **No database** - Simple JSON for card content
- **No payment processing** - Handled through direct payment links in messages
- **No CMS** - Content updates through code
- **No analytics** - Keep it simple, add later if needed

### Data Management
- Card content stored as JSON files
- User preferences in localStorage
- No server-side sessions needed

### JSON Data Structure
**Critical Foundation**: These schemas define the contract between frontend and admin UI.

**pieces.json**:
```json
{
  "pieces": [
    {
      "id": "cassata",
      "name": "Cassata",
      "basePrice": 600,
      "images": ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "3.jpg"],
      "story": "Inspired by the layered Italian ice cream...",
      "tags": ["garden party", "when you're feeling creative", "for making an entrance"],
      "compatibleFabricTypes": ["silk", "cotton", "linen"],
      "genderCategory": "feminine",
      "fabricSurcharge": 50  // Optional premium for certain fabrics
    }
  ]
}
```

**fabrics.json**:
```json
{
  "fabrics": [
    {
      "id": "delhi-silk-blue",
      "name": "Delhi Blue Silk",
      "type": "silk",
      "video": "delhi-silk.mp4",
      "caption": "Found in Old Delhi market",
      "tags": ["airy", "luminous", "drapes-well"],
      "yardsAvailable": 12,
      "costPerYard": 20  // Sachi's cost, not customer price
    }
  ]
}
```

**philosophy.json**, **style.json**, **sachi-moments.json**:
Similar structures with content, visuals, and metadata.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Fabric types enable automatic compatibility
- Base prices set directly (no complex calculations)
- All assets referenced by filename
- IDs enable stable references across updates

### Optional Additions (Only if needed)
- **Tailwind CSS** - If you want utility-first styling
- **Zod** - For JSON validation to ensure data integrity
- **SWR or React Query** - If localStorage performance becomes an issue

## Glossary of Components & Architecture

### Core Components

**Card**
The fundamental unit of interaction. A self-contained component with default and expanded states. Each card type (Piece, Philosophy, Style, Filter, Sachi Moment, Fabric Story) fills the entire screen with its visual content (image or video), using subtle overlays for text or controls. Cards maintain their own state and animate between default and expanded views.

**Card States**
- **Default State**: The swipeable full-screen view seen in the main interface
- **Expanded State**: Card grows to fill screen with additional content (for Piece and Video cards)
- **Collection State**: How card appears when pinned to the collection scrapbook

**Expansion Animation**
The smooth transition when a card grows from its current position to fill the screen. Maintains visual continuity and can be reversed to return card to original position.

**Deck**
The array of cards presented to each user, loaded from static JSON data. Default composition:
- 2 Filter cards (positions 2-3 specifically)
- ~20 Piece cards (added after filter selection)
- ~8 Philosophy cards (scattered throughout)
- ~4 Sachi Moment videos (scattered throughout)
- ~6 Fabric Story cards (scattered throughout)
- Total: ~40 cards (20 without pieces initially)

Default deck composition is hard-coded for simplicity. Filter Cards appear first in sequence and add appropriate piece cards to the deck based on user selections (feminine/masculine preferences).

**Swipe Interface**
The primary navigation pattern. The main view where users encounter cards one at a time, making binary decisions through horizontal swipe gestures (mobile) or arrow keys (desktop).

**Filter Card**
Special cards that appear first in the deck sequence to set preferences. These cards show gender expression options and modify the deck in real-time based on user choices. Also serve as subtle education about Samesisters' inclusive approach to design.

**Fabric Story Card**
Full-screen displays of available fabrics with looping videos showing the fabric in motion. Each includes Sachi's personal discovery stories and cost metadata (hidden from users). Swiping right indicates interest in garments made from that specific fabric. These cards appear smaller in piece card customization, maintaining their video and caption for consistency.

### Views & States

**Piece Card - Expanded State**
The full-screen scrollable state of a Piece Card when tapped. Contains tappable image gallery (not swipeable to avoid confusion with main card swiping), story, customization options with real-time pricing (including pop animations on price changes). Not a separate view but an expanded state of the card component itself. X button returns card to its original position.

**Collection View**
A scrapbook-style display where swiped cards appear pinned at slight angles like a bulletin board. Accessed via the Collection tab in the floating navigation. Each card maintains its ability to expand when tapped. Creates a tactile, personal feeling of curation.

**Simple Deck Management**
Basic logic using localStorage data to track which filter cards were swiped. If user swipes right on "Feminine Silhouettes", feminine pieces are added to the deck. No learning or complex algorithms - just simple flag-based filtering.

### User Journey Elements

**Progressive Disclosure**
The design principle of revealing complexity gradually. Users start with simple swipes, progress to piece exploration, then minimal customization, and finally direct conversation with Sachi.

**State Preservation**
System using localStorage to maintain user progress across sessions. Includes swipe position, collection items, and customization selections. Collection and preferences persist indefinitely unless user clears browser data. Return visitors see their saved collection and can continue where they left off.

**Real-time Pricing Engine**
Simple JavaScript calculation based on fabric selection and modifications. Formula: base price + (fabric cost per yard × yards needed × markup). Always displays as "Around $XXX" to indicate approximate pricing. Price updates trigger a subtle "pop" animation using Framer Motion. No backend needed - prices calculated client-side from JSON data. Final exact price confirmed during conversation with Sachi.

**Piece Configuration**
Each piece in the system includes images, story, time to make, intricacy level, yards needed, and gender category. Base pricing is automatically calculated from time (days × rate) and intricacy multiplier, removing the need for Sachi to set prices manually. This ensures consistent pricing while keeping the admin interface simple.

**Deck Configuration**
Settings that control the composition of the card deck. Developers can adjust the number of each card type (filter, pieces, philosophy, style, Sachi videos, fabric stories) to fine-tune the user experience. Pieces are only added after filter selection. Default composition creates ~26 card initial experience, expanding to ~46 cards with pieces.

**Piece Configuration**
Each piece in the system includes:
- Images and story content
- Base price (set directly by Sachi)
- Tags that blend occasions and moods (e.g., ["garden party", "when you're feeling bold", "for making an entrance"])
- Compatible fabric types (e.g., ["silk", "cotton"])
- Gender category for filtering
- Optional fabric surcharge for premium materials

Tags serve as subtle education, mixing literal occasions with emotional moments and moods. This teaches users that Samesisters creates pieces for special moments - whether that's a specific event or just when you want to feel a certain way.

**Fabric Drops**
When Sachi returns from sourcing trips, she manually updates the fabric JSON with new items, including costs and available yards. Simple announcement through her existing channels (Instagram, text list). No complex infrastructure - just updating content and letting people know what she found and how much is available.

### Technical Architecture

**Deck Building Logic**
Filter cards appear first, followed by philosophy cards, style preference cards, Sachi videos, and fabric stories - but NO piece cards initially. When user swipes right on filter cards (feminine/masculine), corresponding pieces are dynamically added to the remaining deck. If user swipes left on both filters, they complete the experience seeing only brand philosophy and fabric stories. This ensures users only see relevant pieces and creates a personalized journey.

**Session Object**
The data structure in localStorage maintaining user state throughout their journey. Includes liked items (collection), current deck position, filter selections, and active customizations. Keeps the experience seamless across page refreshes.

**Content Management**
Card data stored as static JSON files in the repository. Updates happen through code commits via the admin UI. Fabric-piece compatibility is automatic based on fabric types - no manual selection needed. No database or CMS required.

**Living Inventory**
Samesisters' approach to fabric availability - no automated systems, just Sachi manually tracking what she has. Fabrics come and go based on her sourcing trips. Each fabric's availability tracked in yards (standard for US fashion), cost per yard, and remaining quantity. When inventory hits zero, it's gone forever. This creates genuine scarcity with minimal tech.

**Deep Linking & Clipboard**
Simple approach to messaging:
- Format user selections into message text
- Copy to clipboard using browser API
- Open messaging app (SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram)
- User pastes the pre-formatted message
No complex URL schemes needed - just clipboard and app links.

**Price Pop Animation**
Subtle animation that occurs when price changes in an expanded piece card. Draws user attention to the new approximate price ("Around $XXX") without being jarring. Creates tactile feedback for customization choices.

**Floating Tab Navigation**
The primary navigation element - a rounded, floating tab bar near the bottom of the screen with two options: "Swipe" (main card experience) and "Collection" (scrapbook of liked cards). Always accessible but designed to be non-intrusive to the card experience.

**Message to Commission Flow**
Instead of a traditional cart/checkout, customers click the floating "Text Sachi!" CTA to message her directly via SMS, WhatsApp, or Instagram DM. Their minimal customization selections (fabric, height, size) auto-populate the message, starting a personal conversation about their piece. This eliminates the need for complex e-commerce infrastructure while creating meaningful connections. 

Technical implementation:
- SMS: `sms:+1234567890?body=[encoded message]`
- WhatsApp: `https://wa.me/1234567890?text=[encoded message]`
- Instagram: Deep link to DM (requires Instagram app)

Payment handled through direct links (Venmo/PayPal/Stripe) sent during conversation after design agreement.

**"Looking for 'add to cart'?" Tooltip**
A playful acknowledgment of e-commerce expectations that explains Samesisters' personal approach. Appears as a subtle (?) icon next to the messaging button. When clicked, reveals Sachi's philosophy about conversations over transactions, personal connections adding soul to pieces, and working together to perfect designs. Educates customers on why this different approach creates more meaningful clothing.

**"Text Sachi!" CTA**
The floating call-to-action button fixed to the bottom of expanded piece cards. Replaces traditional "Add to Cart" functionality with direct messaging to Sachi. Reinforces that Samesisters is about personal relationships, not anonymous transactions. Makes the website a portal to conversation rather than a complex e-commerce system.

## Hosting and Updates

### How the Site Works
The Samesisters website follows a simple, modern deployment flow:

1. **Code Storage**: All code and content lives in a GitHub repository
2. **Automatic Deployment**: Vercel watches the GitHub repo and automatically deploys any changes
3. **Custom Domain**: `samesisters.com` points to the Vercel deployment
4. **Zero Downtime**: Updates happen seamlessly in the background

### Setting Up the Domain
- Purchase domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, or directly through Vercel)
- In Vercel dashboard: Add custom domain
- Point domain nameservers to Vercel
- Automatic SSL certificate included
- Result: `samesisters.com` shows your site

### Sachi's Admin Interface
A hidden admin panel at `/sachi-admin` lets Sachi update fabric inventory without touching code:

**Simple Admin UI**:
```
[Password: ________]

Managing Fabrics:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Video preview]                 │
│ Delhi Blue Silk                 │
│ "Found in Old Delhi market"     │
│ Tags: airy, luminous, drapes-well │
│ 12 yards remaining              │
│ Cost: $20/yard                  │

│ [−5 yards] [+5 yards] [Remove] │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

[+ Add New Fabric]
```

**Adding New Fabric**:
- Upload video file (optimized automatically)
- Enter name (e.g., "Jaipur Cotton")
- Add short caption (under 10 words)
- **Add tags** (comma-separated):
  ```
  Tags: [structured] [crisp] [breathable] [+ Add tag]
  Common tags: airy, structured, fluid, crisp, soft, 
  luminous, matte, sheer, opaque, lightweight, 
  drapes-well, holds-shape, breathable, warm
  ```
- Set available yards
- Enter cost per yard (what Sachi paid)
- **Select fabric type**: 
  ```
  Fabric Type:
  ○ Silk
  ● Cotton
  ○ Linen
  ○ Wool
  ○ Synthetic
  ```
- Click save

**Simplified Compatibility System**:
Instead of manually selecting compatible pieces for each fabric, pieces define which fabric types they work with:
```json
// On each piece:
"compatibleFabricTypes": ["silk", "cotton", "linen"]

// On each fabric:
"type": "cotton"
```
This automatically determines compatibility without manual maintenance.

**Managing Pieces**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Image preview]                 │
│ Cassata                         │
│ Base Price: $600                │
│ Tags: garden party, when you're │
│ feeling creative, for making    │
│ an entrance                     │
│                                 │
│ [Edit] [Archive] [Duplicate]    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

[+ Add New Piece]
```

**Adding/Editing Pieces**:
- Upload multiple images (drag & drop)
- Enter name (e.g., "Cassata")
- Write story/inspiration (rich text editor)
- **Add tags** (with suggestions):
  ```
  Tags: [garden party] [when you're feeling creative] [+ Add tag]
  
  Suggestions based on your past tags:
  • gallery opening • cultural celebration • for making an entrance
  • when you're feeling bold • intimate gathering vibes
  • creative wedding guest • festive but not formal
  ```
- Set base price
- Select compatible fabric types: ☑ Silk ☑ Cotton ☑ Linen ☐ Wool
- Choose gender category: ○ Feminine ● Both ○ Masculine
- Optional fabric surcharge amount
- Click save

The tag system learns from Sachi's choices over time, suggesting her commonly used tags while always allowing new ones. This maintains consistency while preserving creative freedom.

### Pricing Calculations (Simplified)
For simplicity, Sachi sets base prices directly on each piece:

**Price Structure**:
- Base price: Set by Sachi for each piece (e.g., $600)
- Fabric surcharge: Optional additional cost for premium fabrics
- Always displays as "Around $XXX" to indicate flexibility
- Final adjustments discussed during conversation

**Example**:
- Dress base price: $600 (set by Sachi)
- Selected fabric: Silk with $50 surcharge
- Display: "Around $650"

This approach is simpler than complex calculations while maintaining transparent pricing.

Example:
- Dress: 3-5 days, Medium intricacy = $675 base
- Needs 3 yards of $20/yard fabric
- Final: $675 + (3 × $20 × 2.5) = "Around $825"

### How Updates Work
1. Sachi makes changes in the admin UI:
   - Add/edit pieces with custom tags
   - Update fabric inventory
   - Archive pieces no longer available
2. Changes are sent to GitHub via API
3. GitHub updates the relevant JSON files (pieces.json, fabrics.json)
4. Vercel sees the change and redeploys (~30 seconds)
5. Website shows updated content immediately

### Developer Configuration
The pricing configuration file allows developers to adjust:
- Daily labor rate (used in base price calculation)
- Intricacy multipliers for each level
- Fabric markup multiplier (default 2.5x)
- Deck composition ratios
- Whether to show prices as approximate

Sachi never needs to set prices directly - she just indicates time and complexity, and the system handles the rest.

### Technical Details
- **Authentication**: Simple hard-coded password for admin access
  ```javascript
  // In admin component
  const ADMIN_PASSWORD = import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD || "sachi2024";
  ```
  - Password can be set in Vercel environment variables
  - Falls back to default for local development
  - No complex auth system needed for MVP
- **GitHub API**: Uses Vercel Edge Functions for secure commits
  - GitHub token stored only in Vercel environment variables
  - Admin UI calls edge function, not GitHub directly
  - Keeps credentials server-side
- **File Storage**: Videos/images stored directly in GitHub repo
  - Videos optimized before upload (max 50MB per file)
  - ~10 main videos + fabric clips fit well within limits
  - No external CDN complexity needed
- **No Database**: Everything stored as JSON files (`pieces.json`, `fabrics.json`) in the repo
- **No Inventory Reservations**: Sachi handles availability during conversation

### Access for Sachi
Simply share the URL `/sachi-admin` and password with Sachi privately. She bookmarks it and uses it like any other website. The GitHub integration happens invisibly in the background - she never needs to create accounts or understand the technical setup.

### Benefits of This Approach
- No monthly fees (except domain registration)
- No complex backend to maintain
- Sachi never sees GitHub or code
- All updates versioned automatically
- Can rollback any changes if needed
- Developers can still update code normally
- User collections persist across visits (via localStorage)

### Future Considerations
If update speed becomes important (currently ~30 seconds), options include:
- Vercel KV for instant updates
- Incremental Static Regeneration
- But for a small catalog, current approach is perfect

## Future Features / Ideas

### "Imagine" AI Preview (Piece × Fabric)
- Show an impressionistic preview when a fabric is selected, approximating how it looks on the piece.
- Generate once per piece × fabric and cache for reuse; no regenerate button.
- If not ready, keep the base photo; swap in when done with a small "Imagination" badge and disclaimer.
- Use the piece photo with a simple mask and the fabric as guidance via a lightweight image-edit API.
- Optional admin control to pre-generate popular combinations.

### Fabric Drop Notifications
Enhance the admin UI with notification capabilities:
- "Save to website" button with optional "Notify followers" checkbox
- When checked, automatically sends message: "Sachi found some new fabrics!"
- Could notify via:
  - SMS to opted-in customers
  - Instagram story API
  - Simple email list
- Shows the new fabrics with their stories

### Customer Photo Gallery
- Customers can text photos of themselves in their pieces
- Sachi can add these to a "Samesisters Stories" section
- Creates community without complex user accounts

### Wishlist via Messaging
- "Save for later" button that texts Sachi: "I'm interested in [piece] when you have [fabric type]"
- Sachi manually messages when similar fabric arrives
- Personal touch on the wishlist concept

### Piece Archive
- Section showing past pieces that are no longer available
- "Commission something similar" option
- Builds aspiration and shows the breadth of work
- Admin UI could have "Archive" checkbox to hide pieces

### Quick Duplicate in Admin
- "Copy this piece" button in admin
- Pre-fills all settings for similar pieces
- Speeds up adding variations

### Fabric Journey Map
- Simple visual showing where Sachi sources fabrics
- Dots on a map with fabric counts
- Tells the global story of Samesisters

### Size Memory
- After first order, customer's measurements saved (with permission)
- Next time they message, Sachi already knows their fit
- Reduces friction for repeat customers

These features maintain the personal, messaging-first approach while gradually enhancing the experience. Each can be added independently as the business grows.
