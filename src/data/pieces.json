      "story": "Inspired by the layered Italian ice cream dessert, the Cassata dress is all about celebration. Its tiered silhouette creates movement with every step, while the fitted bodice provides structure. This piece was born from a wedding in Sicily where I watched the bride change into something more comfortable for dancing - why not have both elegance and ease in one piece? Perfect for garden parties where you want to feel dressed up but still chase after kids, or gallery openings where you'll stand for hours but want to look effortless.",

      "story": "Named after the tennis term that means the score is even, this piece represents balance in all things. A relaxed shirt that can be dressed up or down, with thoughtful details like French seams and mother-of-pearl buttons. I created this after realizing how many of my clients needed something that could transition from a morning meeting to an evening celebration. The slightly longer back hem and side vents make it flattering on every body, while the collar can be worn up for formality or relaxed for ease.",

      "story": "Roja means red in Spanish, but this piece comes in any color that makes you feel powerful. It's a statement jacket with traditional embroidery techniques I learned from my grandmother, updated with a modern cut. Each one takes nearly a week to complete because of the hand-stitched details. This was designed for a client who said she needed 'armor for board meetings that still felt like her culture.' The structured shoulders give confidence, while the flowing back panel adds movement. It's become my most requested piece for women stepping into new chapters.",
